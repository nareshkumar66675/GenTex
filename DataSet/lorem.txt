"ACT I"
"SCENE I. London. The palace."
"Enter KING HENRY, LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER, the EARL of WESTMORELAND, SIR WALTER BLUNT, and others"
"So shaken as we are, so wan with care,"
"Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,"
"And breathe short-winded accents of new broils"
"To be commenced in strands afar remote."
"No more the thirsty entrance of this soil"
"Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood,"
"Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,"
"Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs"
